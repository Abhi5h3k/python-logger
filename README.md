This is a Python logging utility that logs Error, Info, and Debug logs to a file, and automatically deletes log files older than 7 days. It also logs unhandled exceptions.

## Usage
To use this logging utility, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository or download the logger.py file.
2. Import the log object into your Python file using ```from logger import log```
3. Start logging messages using any of the following methods:
```
log.debug('Debug message')
log.info('Info message')
log.error('Error message')
```
## Example
Here's an example usage of this logging utility in a file called example.py:

```
from logger import log

def some_function():
    # some code
    log.info("This is an info message.")
    # some more code

if __name__ == '__main__':
    some_function()

```

When you run this file, it will create a log file in the **logs** directory with a name like **2023-04-18.log**. It will log any info messages to this file, and automatically delete any log files older than 7 days.
